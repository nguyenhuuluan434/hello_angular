/*:host selector base on shadow DOM to render*/
/*This is typical CSS , though you may not have seen or used the :host selector in the
past. Because components need to be as self-contained as possible, they rely on the
Shadow DOM concepts discussed in chapter 1. When Angular renders this component,
it will modify the output to ensure that the CSS selector is unique and doesnâ€™t accidentally
 interfere with other elements on the page. This behavior is configurable, but that
will be covered later.
The host selector is a way to specify that you want the styles to apply to the element
that hosts the element, so in this case it will look at the Summary component element
itself rather than the contents inside it. The primary purpose of the CSS here is to establish the Summary component background color*/

:host .stock-card.increase {
  background: #558B2F;
